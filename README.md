## 💡 Projects

### **SyncUp (Angular, NestJS, PostgreSQL - In Progress)**

A full-stack project management web application under active development. This project is strengthening my core full-stack knowledge, utilizing **Angular** for the frontend, **NestJS** for a scalable, modular backend, and **PostgreSQL** for the database. [**View Repository**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/syncup)

### **CineVerse Dashboard (Angular, Node.js BFF)**
A project designed to strengthen Angular fundamentals, featuring the implementation of a **Backend for Frontend (BFF) server** in Node.js to integrate and manage data from the TMDB API. [**View Repository**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/cineverse-dashboard)

### **EyeSuggest (Dart, Flutter, Firebase)**
A Flutter mobile application that measures visual acuity using a digital Snellen Chart and speech-to-text conversion, enabling users to independently assess vision health. [**View Repository (Screenshots & Video Demo Available)**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/EyeSuggest)

### **Fruit Counting (YOLOv5, Python)**
Trained and deployed a YOLOv5 model to detect and count apples from images, supporting automated fruit yield estimation. [**View Repository (Screenshots Available)**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/FruitCounting) | *(Presented research at the Conference on Technologies for Future Cities - 2021).*
