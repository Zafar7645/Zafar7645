# üëã Hi, I'm Zafar Shaikh (Zafar7645)

**Results-Driven Full Stack Developer | Angular, TypeScript, and Performance Optimization**

I'm a Full Stack Developer with 2 years of professional experience specializing in building robust, high-performance business applications using **Angular** and **TypeScript**. I thrive on refactoring complex codebases, designing efficient RESTful APIs, and implementing automated testing to deliver superior product quality and faster development cycles.

My approach combines technical proficiency with a strong focus on **UI/UX design** and **clean code architecture (SOLID principles)** to build extensible and user-centric solutions.

## üí° Projects

### **CineVerse Dashboard (Angular, Node.js BFF)**
A project designed to strengthen Angular fundamentals, featuring the implementation of a **Backend for Frontend (BFF) server** in Node.js to integrate and manage data from the TMDB API. [**View Repository**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/cineverse-dashboard)

### **SyncUp (MEAN Stack - In Progress)**
Currently developing a full-stack project management web application to deepen my core knowledge of the **MongoDB, Express, Angular, and Node.js (MEAN)** stack.

### **EyeSuggest (Dart, Flutter, Firebase)**
A Flutter mobile application that measures visual acuity using a digital Snellen Chart and speech-to-text conversion, enabling users to independently assess vision health. [**View Repository (Screenshots & Video Demo Available)**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/EyeSuggest)

### **Fruit Counting (YOLOv5, Python)**
Trained and deployed a YOLOv5 model to detect and count apples from images, supporting automated fruit yield estimation. [**View Repository (Screenshots Available)**](https://github.com/Zafar7645/FruitCounting) | *(Presented research at the Conference on Technologies for Future Cities - 2021).*
